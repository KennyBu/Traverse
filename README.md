# Traverse
A sample console app that will traverse folders and print a list of the deepest file names.

Details:
Create a program that will traverse all the folders based on a given path, and print out the names of all text files that reside in the lowest depth folder.

Given:
C:\Temp
	Hello.txt
	\Foo
		Goodbye.txt

If the above folder structure existed and the user entered C:\Temp as the path, the output would be:
Goodbye.txt

Assumptions:

- Please create the file structure starting at c:\ as noted above.

- If the user does not enter a path the program will default to C:\Temp
